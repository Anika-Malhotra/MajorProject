# MajorProject
This project is Credit Card Fraud Detection Using ANN done under research internship during June - August 2023
Created a research project on credit card fraud detection with a multidisciplinary team leveraging machine learning techniques, with a primary focus on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Implemented the model using Python libraries and advanced algorithms, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to enhance fraud detection accuracy. Achieved a significant milestone with an impressive accuracy rate of 96.84% after rigorous fine-tuning, error analysis, and hyperparameter adjustments. Contributed to the academic discourse by addressing challenges related to imbalanced datasets and showcasing the adaptability of ANNs for real-time fraud detection in financial transactions.
